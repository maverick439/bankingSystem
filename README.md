# bankingSystem

Letâ€™s build a banking system where user can check his account details and transactions.
A user must sign-in to call any apis. Once a user is registered, it undergoes a verification process.
The verification process is a set of rules. Only after the user passes the set of verification rules,
does it get allowed to access further apis.
Once its verified, the user can create transactions and check his balance.
